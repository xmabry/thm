# Introduction to DevSecOps

This room was a great introduction to the major concepts for DevSecOps. Mostly reading room vs a hands on more tactical one. It was good to see that the challenges were also front and center in this room so as to not give the perception that this DevSecOps thing was something easy to dopt over night ad it can be left alone once adopted. Key take aways from this room I got:

Siloes can be combatted with Collaboration and Autonomy, where we trust each other to do the job at hand and to be seeking the best interested of the colective. It's not "us vs them" but "we"

Lack of Visibility and Prioritization can be combatted with Transparency and Accountabilityacross all organizations involved.

Stringent or Unsustainable Security practices can be counterproductive in a space where innovatioin and speed are necessary to keep up with business demand. This can be combatted with establishing guardrails for which innovation can take place securely.
