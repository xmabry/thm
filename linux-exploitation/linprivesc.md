# TASK 3
This task highlighted some commonly used commands for Linux to help guide you into who you are, what connectivity from this device is, and what to look for as possible vulnerability.
- ```uname -a ```
- ``` hostname  ```
- ```cat /proc/version```
- ```cat /etc/issue```
- ```ps -A ``` or ```ps axjf```
- ```sudo -l```
- ```cat /etc/passwd```
- ```ifconfig```
- ```netstat -at```
- ```find /home -name flag1.txt```  or ``` find / -type f -perm 0777 ```
    - ``` find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null ``` allows you to find SUID bit files, which allows us to run the file with a higher privilege level than the current user.


# TASK 5
In the room for the Linux Exploitation Task 5, you'll need to use the HackBox to create a new file called `ofs.c` with the contents of the `CVE-2015-1328.c` in it. This is based on the content of the exploit here https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292. Spin up a python3 server by executing: 
    ``` python3 -m http.server 9000```
Then from the target computer, you'll use wget to download the ofs.c file and compile it using the command:
    ```gcc ofs.c -o ofs```
This should result in you opening a shell that results in you being root
